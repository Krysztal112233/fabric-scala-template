# Fabric Scala Template

This repository show you the basic Scala mod structure.

Of course, you can also use this repository as your template, it's totally available :).

## Difference

This repository use `krysztal-language-scala` - the `kls` as it's Scala runtime dependency.

Because of the `fabric-language-scala` missing maintenance for long time it's totally unusable and outdated.
